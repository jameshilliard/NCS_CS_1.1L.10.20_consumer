News for the 1.6.9 release
	Wed, 23 Nov 2005 09:52:30 +0100

	* Fixed timezone calculation during daylight saving.
	* Fixed a warning message in file destinations which indicated that
          permissions would be changed even if no permission change was
          requested.
	* Added a workaround for lose-one-message when connection is broken.
	* Owner and group information on files is set independently, so one can
          work while the other fails, this fixes the behaviour when
          syslog-ng is running as non-root and only the group information is
          specified.
	* Documentation updates.
	* Updated bundled libol to 0.3.17

	Thu, 26 May 2005 10:24:33 +0200

          explicit tzset() call.
	* Fixed resolving the PRI macro which always expanded to an empty
          string.
	* Fixed possible hang during reload for one second.
	* Fixed syslog2ng script which sometimes generated three dots when
	  generating priority ranges. (debug...emerg)
	* Added a notification about splitting message lines, if they are
          over the configured log_msg_size() limit.
 	* Added a setsid() call to program destinations to avoid being in
          the same process group as the child, as some shells send signals
          to the whole process group they are in, effectively killing
          syslog-ng. (triggered on OpenBSD for example)
	* Added log_fifo_size option to TCP/UDP destinations.
	* Added relogger.pl to contrib/ which replays existing syslog files.
	* Updated documentation (manpages and SGML documentation)

	* fixed possible abort when several UNIX domain sources refer to the
	  same socket
 	* fixed afunix and afinet destination template handling, do not include
 	  the PRI value automatically, let the administrator do it
 	  explicitly in its template
 	* fixed possible segfault when the value of 0 is represented as a
 	  string in port specications (e.g. remoteport, localport, port)
	* added MSGONLY macro which expands to the message only without the
 	  program name which sent the log message
 	* added global sanitize_filenames() option which changes control
 	  characters in all filenames to '.', defaults to TRUE, this might
 	  avoid escape sequence attacks embedded in filenames (imagine an
 	  administrator doing an ls in a directory where filenames contain
 	  any control characters)
 	* avoid using GNU extensions in strftime (more specificly the
 	  timezone expansion in $ISODATE used %z which is not portable for
 	  IRIX)

	Mon, 20 Jan 2003 16:34:03 +0100

	* The previous kernel bug workaround in libol fixed the issue for
	  the 2.4.20rc? kernels only, the current workaround should also
	  work for 2.4.20 final as well.
	* Added bad_hostname() feature where the administrator can specify
          a regular expression to match bad hostnames, works around bad
	  programs such as ctld which uses a space within its program name.


News for the 1.5.24 release
	Wed, 18 Dec 2002 13:45:41 +0100

	* fixed a crashbug, which has security implications, as it is caused 
          by a stack overflow, it occurs when destination file output
          templates are used (file contents are specified by a template).
	  Everybody is urged to upgrade to this version. 

News for the 1.5.20 release
	Thu, 22 Aug 2002 16:03:45 +0200

	* fixed a kernel message mangling problem
	* implemented check_hostname() which checks if a hostname is
	  acceptable (contains characters [0-9a-zA-Z-_.], and if not, it is
	  not parsed as hostname, this fixes problems with devices which
          send messages which seem to contain a hostname, but in reality
	  they don't

          (they erroneously changed the destination address)
	* Detect O_LARGEFILE on the system and use it if available

	    AIX support added, HP-UX partially supported (untested))
	  * improved stability

	features. The 1.5.x development cycle is forked so expect
	exciting new stuff in those releases.

News for the 1.4.0rc2 release

        Changed the lexical scanner to be a bit more friendly wrt '..'. You
        can now use debug..info instead of debug .. info.
