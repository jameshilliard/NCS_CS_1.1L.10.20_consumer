This is syslog-ng. Welcome.
===========================

What is syslog-ng?
==================
Syslog-ng tries to fill the gaps original syslogd's were lacking:
	* powerful configurability
	* filtering based on message content
	* message integrity, message encryption (not yet implemented in 1.4.x)
	* portability
	* better network forwarding

Version numbering is similar to that of Linux kernels, odd numbers denote
unstable or development versions, even numbers denote stable, production use
releases. 1.0.x code was based on Darren Reed's nsyslog, and it was
completely rewritten during 1.1.x - 1.3.x. 

1.6.x is the current stable version of syslog-ng.

Hacking on syslog-ng
====================

Syslog-ng uses a nonblocking I/O, and OO library called libol. Libol uses
a preprocessor to generate object definitions and information for the gc
to collect garbage. Object definitions are structs and some small functions,
and are placed in a file named something.c.x or something.h.x. These .x
files are then included in the C source files.

This preprocessor is written in Scheme, and requires scsh to run, but is not
required to simply compile syslog-ng, since all needed .x files are included
in the distribution. If you change a source file though, the .x file needs
to be regenerated.

By default all generated files are included in the distribution
so scsh is only required if you want to change something in the source
files.

If the change you apply, doesn't change object definitions you don't
need to rerun make_class, simply update the date of the .x file using touch:

touch something.c.x
