2006-03-27  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped to 0.3.18

2006-03-13  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* src/io.c: removed fd counting loop, cache maximum number of fds
	and allocate the fds array dynamically

2006-01-23  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* src/io.c (do_write): added support for platforms without an
	MSG_DONTWAIT flag

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.17

	* src/io.c (do_write): added workaround for broken destination
	sockets

	if A_WRITE returns failure by pushing it back to the buffer

2005-05-03  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.16

	* src/io.c (io_iter): fixed possible nonblocking_fd leaks as
	unlinking an fd might have dropped some valid structures

	* src/werror.c: fixed werror_hexdump and related functions,
	still #if 0ed but useful for tracking down gc related problems

2005-02-04  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped verison number to 0.3.15

2005-02-01  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* src/werror.c (msg_vformat): fixed signed/unsigned comparison wrt
	the length variable, a stack overflow (not buffer overflow) can be
	caused by a very long format result (werror("%2147483648i", 1)),
	credits go to Thief_hu for reporting it; it is believed not to be
	exploitable as werror format strings do not contain dynamic values

2004-08-05  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.14, cleaned up to
	work with autoconf2.50 and automake 1.7

	on BSD derived systems

2004-07-04  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@bzorp.balabit>

2003-01-31  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.9

	* src/pkt_buffer.c: it is now possible whether flushing to the
	output is done by message-by-message (UDP) or stream based (TCP),
	as stream based flush could cause more than one message included
	in a single UDP frame during high loads

2003-01-20  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* src/pkt_buffer.c: fixed a bug which caused garbled output lines
	when a target buffer was full

	instead of using all CPU time

2002-12-18  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.6

2002-11-12  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* src/io.c (sockaddr2info): do not take unknown address families
	fatal, support AF_UNSPEC (returned by Solaris)

2002-11-04  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* src/werror.c: allocate space for message as required (instead of
	maximizing the number of bytes to 1024)

	* src/io.c (inet_address2sockaddr_in): handle the case when the IP
	of the host is NULL, but the port isn't

	* configure.in: --with-debug changed to --enable-debug

2002-05-29  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.3

	* src/xalloc.c: when freeing a memory location in debug mode,
	actively change the stored original block size, so references to
	already freed memory locations can be detected easier,
	(ol_string_free): added an assertion on s->use_cnt

	* src/io.c: when a POLLHUP is received on an inactive fd, kill fd
	immediately (earlier we waited for flushing, but in case of
	POLLHUP we can't flush anyway) This fixes an abort() problem.

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 0.3.2

	later syslog-ng versions

2002-03-21  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* acconfig.h: removed 0 after #undef DEBUG_ALLOC because it

	should be resolved

2001-10-24  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	* acconfig.h: changed #define DEBUG_ALLOC 0 to #undef DEBUG_ALLOC

2001-08-26  Balazs Scheidler  <bazsi@balabit.balabit>

	flush,
	(write_callback): implemented fsync

	* io.h (io_fd): added fsync attribute
